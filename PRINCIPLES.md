# Presto Foundation Principles

## 1) One open, neutral and united Presto community 

One of the main reasons the founding members came together and created the Presto Foundation was to unite the Presto community. The Presto community and it’s contributors have been working on many great capabilities and connectors, and many of these haven’t made their way back into the repo, and we truly believe that these can benefit many other users. We invite all Presto community members to embrace PrestoDB and contribute back to move the project faster, reduce duplication of efforts and create wider impact for the entire community.

## 2) Open, transparent technical leadership and direction

At the end of the day, technology and technical direction is what keeps a community interested and the innovation going. We want the project to be inclusive and the technical roadmap to be fairly representative of the community’s view. In fact, the [TSC](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc) has its own open [charter](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CHARTER.md) and the meetings are open for everyone to attend.  We invite you to join the TSC meetings. We believe under the open and transparent governance of TSC, the PrestoDB project will continue to grow, gain contributors, and solve some hard technical challenges. 

## 3) No one individual or company is greater than the project and its community

The Linux Foundation is dedicated to building sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate technology development and commercial adoption. It is the home of Linux creator Linus Torvalds, and most importantly provides a neutral home to Linux and other projects where their development can be protected and accelerated for years to come. This important principle of neutrality has been the core of Linux Foundation as well as Apache Software Foundation so that no one individual or company agenda becomes that of the projects. Neutrality will drive the approach to governance that we have adopted so that no single company or individual can take undue influence.
